      <h3>BuzzCycle sets new landspeed record for electric vehicles</h3>
      <p>Posted on October 16, 2012</p>
    </div>
    <p>In yet another instance of green turning mean, famed electric-powered drag racing two-wheeler BuzzCycle has set a new landspeed record for electric vehicles, posting a quarter mile time of 8.083 seconds at Cape Coral Drag Speedway last weekend.</p>
    <p>At a maximum output of 3200 kw/sec, BuzzCycle can unleash enough torque to finish the quarter mile within a few thousandths of a second of leading gas-powered drag racing motorcycles. This capability, combined with an eerie lack of engine noise, has sparked a new nickname for the cycle and driver Marty Watts: Silent Violence.</p>
    <p>That said, we expect to hear a lot more noise from the BuzzCycle camp as this year's national MDRA competition approaches.    </p>

      <h3>Sousa revives Noir with sultry thriller</h3>
      <p>Posted on October 15, 2012</p>
    </div>
    <p>Already hard at work researching his next film, Mark Sousa has recently been seen reading up on the private eye genre, ¬ùaccording to our own highly leveraged sources.</p>
    <p>Although the rumor mill places Sousa in the 1940s era film noir homage as a private investigator working through a tangled web of deceit and murder, Director Eugene Hedberg has been coyly suggesting these reports are just another public relations red herring.</p>
    <p>We'll be busy pursuing our industry insiders for the vital clues. In the meantime, don't miss this issue's feature article on Sousa in Double Identity, out early2013.    </p>

      <h3>DJ L-Koo teams with calendar girls to launch new Hollywood hangout</h3>
      <p>Posted on October 14, 2012</p>
    </div>
    <p>Wherever you were last Friday night, you're wishing you were with us at Blingshizzle, the latest soon-to-be hallowed hall of Hollywood hotness. The brainchild of incendiary Hong Kong beatmaster DJ L-Koo, this urban upstart club is leading the curve in high-style lounge nightlife, boasting three levels of action, each themed with its own interstellar decor.</p>
    <p>The 2012 Check Magazine Calendar Girls were on hand and in heels at Blingshizzle for the grand opening last Friday -- all except Luisa Znickflos, who had to temporarily wriggle out of her stateside calenderly duties to make a swimsuit shoot on the sun-soaked beaches of Cabo San Lucas. (We're still a bit salty, but we'll let this one slide, Luisa.)<br>
